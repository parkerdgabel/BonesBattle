This ReadMe.txt file should have been found packaged with the
following Java .class and .java files:

    Bones.class
    MilquetoastStrategy.class
    MilquetoastStrategy.java
    Player.class
    Strategy.class
    Strategy.java
    StrategyLoader.class

You should place these files in an otherwise un-cluttered
folder/subdirectory.

When you have compiled your ComputerStrategy.java, Territory.java,
Map.java, and Graph.java files to create the ComputerStrategy.class,
Territory.class, Map.class, and Graph.class files, copy them into
the same folder/subdirectory as the supplied files.
Then, just run the game from the command line:

  java Bones

If you wrote your four classes correctly and completely, the
game should be completely playable.  If the game crashes, well,
you have some debugging to do.
